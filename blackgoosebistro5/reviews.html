I didn't know what it was just yet, mind you we were drinking so my tastebuds are turnt up at this point. He pulls out a hot sausage po- boy that was at least 2 feet. I'm amazed now, so he tells me he got it from eastside cash n carry. I've never heard of this place but i didn't care I knew I had to try it. I go down Chef and hit the store and i'm nothing short of satisfied. The 32 inch hot sausage was $9!! I couldn't believe it, it was the best sandwich i've had and it was fully dressed as well. What makes it better was that it was just one guy in the kitchen taking all the orders at once. My mans had the assembly line going back there. I say that to say i'd go to to this place every damn day if i could!</li> <br>


<li>Review from Madison A. - Metairie, LA: I stopped here one afternoon to have a quick bite to eat on my unch break, should you be in this area needing a screen repair (since the shop is right next door) while on an empty stomach! Spread love, make peace, and get the amazing couscous!</li> <br>
