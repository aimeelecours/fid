In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food <i>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</i> into a water bath that is <dfn>precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.</dfn> In his book, <q>Cooking for Geeks,</q> Jeff Potter describes it as <cite>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</cite></p><p>Next month, <br> we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. <br> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime=2021-11-30">November 30.</time></p><p>blackgoose@example.com<br>555-336-1800</p><p><small>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p></article>
