I didn't know what it was just yet, mind you we were drinking so my tastebuds are turnt up at this point. He pulls out the most delicious cakepops I have ever seen. What makes it better was that it was just one guy in the kitchen taking all the orders at once. My mans had the assembly line going back there. I say that to say i'd go to to this place every damn day if i could!</li> <br>


<li>Review from Madison A. - Metairie, LA: I stopped here one afternoon to have a quick treat to eat on my lunch break, should you be in this area needing a screen repair (since the shop is right next door) while on an empty stomach! Spread love, make peace, and get the cupcakes!!</li> <br>
